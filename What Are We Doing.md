We opened up the repo and made a basic diagram of how the DB will work.

## 15th of September 2020
We added in a config template and installed express.

## 16th of September 2020
We added in the tables we'll need into our code.

### Explanation on Slugs:
Slugs make names that work better for URLs.
Example: Sana Rinomi => sana_rinomi

We created a basic authentication class and started adding in register and DB functions.
